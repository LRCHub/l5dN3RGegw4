Breaking the lines and bury what's coming
This common sense you're ignoring
'Cause you're next up to fall out with not dealing
With all the doubt, you still are not facing
Forget the world's reaction to this
Chemical attraction that I've
Always known but never could savor
Press play repeat, then start the cycle
That's been feeding on me
Everyday I keep digging a deeper grave

In God we mistrusted
The truth left all of us disgusted

A toast to the ghosts in our home still alive
Gave all they had for a flag
But the dream has died
But the dream has died

I take it, you've said enough
No, thank you for warning us
So obvious, my mistake
You think that I won't give up
I've gone and I've had enough
So what I've left miles away

In God we mistrusted
The truth left all of us disgusted

A toast to the ghosts in our home still alive
Gave all they had for a flag
But the dream has died
But the dream has died
But the dream has died

In God we mistrusted
In God we mistrusted
